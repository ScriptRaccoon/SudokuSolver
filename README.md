# Sudoku solver

Demo: https://sudokusolverapp.netlify.app

This is a Sudoku solver based on the usual backtracking method.

The focus is here on the functions and the design of the user interface.

This app is built in Vanilla JS. I have [another version](https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/SudokuSolverSvelte) with Svelte.
